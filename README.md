# Predicting and Analyzing Race Results During a Formula 1 Season
James Lambert

Goal:  The primary goal of this project was to predict a Formula 1 race winner from that season's team and driver stats.  The ultimate ambition for this project is to use a predictive model as a starting point for insight as to racer and team success to provide a foundational foundation as to how well a team/driver will do based on those metrics.
