## Predicting and Analyzing Race Results During a F1 Season

Goal:  The primary goal of this project was to predict a Formula 1 race winner from that season's team and driver stats.  The ultimate ambition for this project is to use a predictive model as a starting point for insight as to racer and team success to provide a foundational foundation as to how well a team/driver will do based on those metrics.

## Define the Question

Are we able to predict which team and individual racer wins a Formula 1 race based on team statistics, and the racers past success?

## Supplementary background and interest in this Sport 

Formula 1 is broken down into two championships: a team championship where two drivers on the same team compete and pool one another's points together for the team.  The latter is an individual championship in which each driver is fighting for themselves.  

### So why is determining these two-metrics important?
1.  It can provide an estimate of which team and driver has the potential to win the championship at the end of the year.
2.  You could bet on it in a betting platform if you believe in your model
3.  I have a passion for the sport and wanted to dive more in the data for some new insight and knowledge to further my    interests involving the sport
  
## Data Gathering
The data was gathered from a project on Kaggle.(< https://www.kaggle.com/cjgdev/formula-1-race-data-19502017> )
