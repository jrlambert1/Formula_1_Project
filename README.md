Formula 1 is broken down into two championships: a team championship where two drivers on the same team compete and pool one another's points together for the team.  The latter is an individual championship in which each driver is fighting for themselves.  

So why is determining these two-metrics important?
a.  It can provide an estimate of which team and driver has the potential to win the championship at the end of the year.
	b.  You could bet on it in a betting platform if you believe in your model
c.  I have a passion for the sport and wanted to dive more in the data for some new insight and knowledge to further my interests involving the sport

Data Cleaning
Having the datasets come from Kaggle, the information is relatively clean and doesn't have many nulls.  The issue is relevant information is only available to certain periods of time such as qualifying lap times for every year.
	-Qualifying information on Kaggle contained roughly a quarter of all races

Here is a snapshot description of model preparation including:

	-renamed columns to better describe column
	-renamed misspelt names (ex. Finish Surnames needed to be changed for accuracy)
